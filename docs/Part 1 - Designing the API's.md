How can you utilize code generation to speed up the development process and only focus on what is important, the business logic? In this mini-series we will explore the ways AsyncAPI and code generation can work hand in hand beyond generating documentation. 

The source code for the entire project can be found [here](https://github.com/jonaslagoni/asyncapi-miniseries) incase you want more specific details then what is available in the blog posts.

Structure of the miniseries:
* **Part 1: Designing the API's with AsyncAPI**
* Part 2: Implementing the applications using code generation
* Part 3: Black-box testing the applications using code generation
* Part 4: Introducing new changes when using code generation
* Part 5: The path to 1 billion players - Scaling the applications and finding bottlenecks with code generation

**Don't see this blog post series as anything other then an example workflow, this is purely how I do it with my applications and how I use AsyncAPI and it's tooling to my advantage. Use this as an inspiration to finding an approach that works for you.**

# What we are building

A passion of mine, beside AsyncAPI, is online games, more specifically creating and maintaining game servers while providing a network of services around them. This passion was what eventually made me start to contribute to AsyncAPI back in 2019.
 
Explaining something is always better with actual examples, therefore I will be creating a little system to show you how code generation can help the development process starting from defining your API's with AsyncAPI.

![General setup](/img/posts/jonaslagoni-miniseries/blog-miniseries-general-setup.png)

I will be creating a system of two applications, a **game server** and a **backend processor** using a micro-service architecture with no public facing API. How a player interact with the **game server** could be through a phone, a computer, Xbox or PlayStation, for us this is out of scope for this project, we only care about the interaction between the **game server** and the **backend processor**. That being said, you could probably use AsyncAPI for this as well :thinking: 

The main point of the **game server** will be to simulate the interaction of the player. This means it will simulate the following events: when players join the game server, pick up items in game, uses the chat, hit one another, and eventually disconnect.

The **backend processor** will be subscribing to these events to process them. In our example it will simply save the received data directly to a database.

I will not get into the specifics of the stack for this system yet since it have no effect on the writing of the API documents for the two applications.
# Designing the API's with AsyncAPI
I always use the [design first principle](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/api-design-first-vs-code-first), even when we are talking about internal systems, which means describing the two applications, **game server** and **backend processor** using the AsyncAPI specification before implementing them.

Using AsyncAPI to define an internal system is not entirely apparent how to do, since AsyncAPI is build to define behavior from the perspective of the external user. I will be clarifying this a bit more later on with actual examples, but if you want to go deeper into this, you can read this - [Publish vs Subscribe semantics in AsyncAPI](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/integration/blogs/nic-townsend1/2021/04/01/publish-vs-subscribe-in-asyncapi-and-why-it-may-no). 

## The game server
I always start basic, and first define all the different channels for which the **game server** should produce events over.

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.0.0
info: 
  title: "Game server"
  version: "0.0.1"
channels: 
  game/server/{serverId}/events/player/{playerId}/item/{itemId}/pickup:
    description: Channel used when a player picks up an item in-game
  game/server/{serverId}/events/player/{playerId}/connect:
    description: Channel used when a player joins (connect to) the game server
  game/server/{serverId}/events/player/{playerId}/disconnect:
    description: Channel used when a player leaves (disconnects from) the game server
  game/server/{serverId}/events/player/{playerId}/chat: 
    description: Channel used when a player writes something in chat
  game/server/{serverId}/events/player/{playerId}/hit: 
    description: Channel used when a player hit another player in-game
```

Channels must be defined as a [RFC 6570 URI template](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0#channelsObject). The way I like to structure my channels, is to utilize `parameters` to separate the action from information about the event, so it describes, on what server the event was performed `{serverId}`, by what player `{playerId}` and in case of `pickup` what item `{itemId}` gets picked up. For the last part of the channel we describe what the event was, for example `connect`, `disconnect`, etc.

Next we define the actual definition of the channels, and here I will focus on explaining, in full, the channel `game/server/{server_id}/events/player/{player_id}/item/{item_id}/pickup`. The rest of the channels can be seen [here]().

```yaml
...
  game/server/{serverId}/events/player/{playerId}/item/{itemId}/pickup:
    description: Channel used when a player picks up an item in-game
    parameters:
      serverId: 
        description: The id of the server the action was performed on
        schema: 
          type: string
      playerId: 
        description: The id of the player who performed the action
        schema: 
          type: string
      itemId: 
        description: The id of item picked up
        schema: 
          type: string
    subscribe: 
      message:
        payload:
          type: object
          $id: PlayerItemPickupPayload
          additionalProperties: false
          properties:
            pickupTimestamp:
              type: string
              format: date-time
              description: The timestamp the item was picked up
...
```
This is the full AsyncAPI channel definition for describing the event for when a player picks up an item in-game.

First we have the definition of `parameters` used in the channel. `serverId` tells us where the action originates from, the `playerId` tells us who performed the action, and the `itemId` tells us which item was picked up and should all validate against a value with type `string`.

![General setup](/img/posts/jonaslagoni-miniseries/blog-miniseries-gameserver-api.png)

Next we have the `subscribe` operation, which might not make much sense. We do want the **game server** to publish this event right? Correct, but this is how you currently define operations in AsyncAPI. You define the operation others can interact with. This means that the **game server** publishes on this channel and others can `subscribe` to this channel \[[1](#view-property)\]\[[3](#clarify-view)\]. 

The `payload` of the channel (is described using a super-set of JSON Schema draft 7) should validate against an `object` which contains the property `pickupTimestamp`, which should validate against a `string`. When `additionalProperties` is `false`, no extra properties may be added to the object (by default this is `true` in JSON Schema draft 7). The `$id` keyword are used as an identifier for that specific schema, in this case we name the object schema `PlayerItemPickupPayload`.

## The backend processor
Next we design the **backend processor** API which contains all the same channels as the **game server**, but with a different operation keyword. 


![General setup](/img/posts/jonaslagoni-miniseries/blog-miniseries-processor-api.png)

This is again because we want to define how others may interact with our **backend processor**. This means that instead of using the `subscribe` operation we use `publish` to tell others that they can publish to this channel since the backend process are subscribing to it. The full AsyncAPI document for the **backend processor** can be found [here](). 

```yaml
...
  game/server/{serverId}/events/player/{playerId}/item/{itemId}/pickup:
    ...
    publish: 
      ...
...
```

## Reusability
At the moment each of the AsyncAPI documents contains their own definition of the channels. But what if we where to add a new validation rule such as a new property to the `playerItemPickupPayload` schema? In our case we would have to change this for both applications which is way too much work :smile:

We can therefore introduce `$ref` to separate the parameters and messages into smaller sections for reusability. I will be placing all separate components into a `components` directory in the same directory the AsyncAPI documents reside.

Just a quick note, at the moment it is not possible to reuse channels and operations directly, therefore we must do it to the parameters and message individually \[[2](#channel-reusability)\]. 

First we separate the different parameters, for simplicity we add all of them into the same file `./components/Parameters.yaml`.
```yaml
serverId:
  description: The id of the server
  schema: 
    type: string
playerId:
  description: The id of the player who performed the action
  schema: 
    type: string
itemId:
  description: The id of item
  schema: 
    type: string
```

And then change all the channel parameters to reference the external parameter definition.
```yaml
...
  game/server/{serverId}/events/player/{playerId}/item/{itemId}/pickup:
    description: Channel used when a player picks up an item in-game
    parameters:
      serverId: 
        $ref: "./components/Parameters.yaml#/serverId"
      playerId: 
        $ref: "./components/Parameters.yaml#/playerId"
      itemId: 
        $ref: "./components/Parameters.yaml#/itemId"
    ...
...
```

For the messages we add a new file per message instead of keeping everything in the same file as parameters, I use this approach since I find it easier to maintain and extend.

We add the message file `./components/messages/PlayerItemPickup.yaml`
```yaml
payload:
  type: object
  $id: PlayerItemPickupPayload
  additionalProperties: false
  properties:
    pickupTimestamp:     
      type: string
      format: date-time
      description: The timestamp the item was picked up
```

and alter the channel definition for the **game server** to:
```yaml
...
  game/server/{serverId}/events/player/{playerId}/item/{itemId}/pickup:
    description: Channel used when a player picks up an item in-game
    parameters:
      serverId: 
        $ref: "./components/Parameters.yaml#/serverId"
      playerId: 
        $ref: "./components/Parameters.yaml#7playerId"
      itemId: 
        $ref: "./components/Parameters.yaml#/itemId"
    subscribe: 
      message:
        $ref: './components/messages/PlayerItemPickup.yaml'
...
```

These changes are done to the **backend processor** as well to end up with the following documents:
* [AsyncAPI document for the game server]()
* [AsyncAPI document for the processor]()

## What's next
Now that our API's are designed for our two applications, we can move on to [Part 2: Implementing the applications using code generation]().
